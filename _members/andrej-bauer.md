Andrej Bauer is a professor of computational mathematics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, and the head of Theoretical Computer Science department at the Institute of mathematics, physics and mechanics.

His work spans foundations of mathematics, constructive and computable mathematics, type theory, homotopy type theory, and mathematical principles of programming languages. He is an author of the book “Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics” and the initiator of the HoTT library, an extensive formalization of homotopy type theory in the Coq proof assistant. He is also known for his seminal work with Matija Pretnar on programming with algebraic effects and handlers.
