# Computationally intensive mathematical methods

We develop new methods in computational mathematics and apply them to problems from versatile problem domains, including exploration of mathematical structures in discrete mathematics, geometry, combinatorics, formalisation and management of mathematical knowledge, and large network analysis. Our applications are grounded in state-of-the-art theoretical research in discrete and numerical mathematics and theoretical computer science.

## Research topics

**Discrete geometry and symmetries of discrete objects**
: `YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE`

: **Researchers:**
Tomaž Pisanski,
Nino Bašić,
Primož Potočnik,
Arjana Žitnik

**Enumerative and algebraic combinatorics**
: We use sophisticated techniques for enumeration (both exact and approximate) of objects arising in algebra and geometry.

: **Researchers:**
Matjaž Konvalinka

**Mathematical chemistry**
: We study properties of graph classes that with relevance in chemistry (e.g. benzenoids and fullerenes graphs). We are interested in spectral properties of graphs (e.g. nullity), combinatorial properties of graphs (e.g. the number of perfect matchings) and their enumeration.
: `YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE` Subtopic:  Nut graphs. Self-assembly. Topological indices

Tomaž Pisanski

**Mathematical knowledge management**
: We collaborate with the [Research Group of the Professorship for Knowledge Representation and Processing at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://kwarc.info/) on the mathematical data platform [MathDataHub](https://data.mathhub.info/).

: **Researchers:**
Katja Berčič,

**Network and data analysis**
: `YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE`

: **Researchers:**
Vladimir Batagelj,
Simona Korenjak Černe,
Tomaž Pisanski


**Foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science**
: We explore mathematical foundations of computation and data processing. Our explorations in type theory and programming languages aid development of proof assistants, formalised mathematics and programming languages.

Filip Koprivec,
Matija Pretnar,
Egbert Rijke,
Alex Simpson

**Numerical methods**
: We study systems of bivariate polynomials and applications, new interpolation and approximation schemes, the inverse eigenvalue problem and cubic splines in the context of computer aided geometric design.
